<td>Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration (IFSAC) category (<a href="../0001179/">IFSAC_category</a>)</td>
<td>The IFSAC food categorization scheme has five distinct levels to which foods can be assigned, depending upon the type of food. First, foods are assigned to one of four food groups (aquatic animals, land animals, plants, and other). Food groups include increasingly specific food categories; dairy, eggs, meat and poultry, and game are in the land animal food group, and the category meat and poultry is further subdivided into more specific categories of meat (beef, pork, other meat) and poultry (chicken, turkey, other poultry). Finally, foods are differentiated by differences in food processing (such as pasteurized fluid dairy products, unpasteurized fluid dairy products, pasteurized solid and semi-solid dairy products, and unpasteurized solid and semi-solid dairy products. An IFSAC food category chart is available from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/ifsac/projects/food-categorization-scheme.html">https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/ifsac/projects/food-categorization-scheme.html</a> PMID: 28926300</td>
