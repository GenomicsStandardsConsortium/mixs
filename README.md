# MIxS: Minimum Information about any (X) Sequence

⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ 

The GSC is preparing for the MIxS 6.2.0 release. Thanks to everyone who has contributed in any way!

The new release primarily consists of converting a spreadsheet expressing MIxS 6.1 into a [LinkML artifact, which now serves as the source of truth](https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/blob/main/src/mixs/schema/mixs.yaml). 
We have also started to follow the [LinkML cookiecutter layout](https://github.com/linkml/linkml-project-cookiecutter).
MIxS users should see very few changes in the content, although legacy term attributes like "Definition", "Expected value", "Value syntax" and "Section" have been broken down into their LinkML equivalents, 
like `description`, `range`, `pattern` and `in_subset`.

We have [some known issues](https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A6.1.1-%3E6.2.0), and you may find others. [Please report them](https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/issues) including text snippets and or screen shots!

**Until this message is removed:**
-  You can continue to use any MIxS 6.0 to 6.1.1 artifacts you have previously downloaded.
 - Or start some new downloads by browsing https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/tree/mixs6.1.1/mixs.

If you have questions or concerns in the interim, please contact gensc-twg@groups.google.com

Below is documentation about the contents of the various folders/directories in this repository.

* [assets/](assets/) - files consumed by, or generated by maintenance scripts in [src/scripts](src/scripts/)
* [examples/](examples/) - examples of different kinds of data files in different data formats in different (JSON, YAML) containing data conformant with MIxS standard
* [mixs-templates/](mixs-templates/) -  MIxS schema (meta)data collection templates in the Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx) format

* [src/](src/)
  * [src/data/examples/](src/data/examples/) - valid and invalid data examples 
  * The folder structure (*valid* and *invalid* folders), and the corresponding YAML data examples in this directory need to follow guidelines in accordance with the `linkml-run-examples` *testing framework*
  * [src/mixs/](src/mixs/)
    * [src/mixs/datamodel/](src/mixs/datamodel/) - Python dataclasses artifact generated by running the LinkML Python generator on MIxS schema file
    * [src/mixs/schema/](src/mixs/schema/)
      * [src/mixs/schema/mixs.yaml](src/mixs/schema/mixs.yaml) - LinkML YAML schema representing the MIxS standard

  * [src/docs](src/docs) - markdown files that can be converted to HTML and rendered through the mkdocs/GitHub Pages system setup by default with LinkML project cookiecutter
  * [src/scripts](src/scripts) - Python scripts for specific discovery/exploration/inference based on the MIxS YAML schema
* [tests/](tests/) - test data files
* [config.yaml](config.yaml) - config file to custom specify arguments for the LinkML project generator
* [Makefile](Makefile) - Makefile containing pre-defined linkml-project-cookiecutter targets/rules
* [project.Makefile](project.Makefile) - file that can be modified to extend pre-defined rules in [Makefile](Makefile)
