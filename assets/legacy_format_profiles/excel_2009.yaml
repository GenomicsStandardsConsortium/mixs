# Additional notes for this format
notes: |
  The 2009 format predates standardization. Key differences:
  - Sheet named "Recovered_Sheet1" (possibly from file recovery)
  - "Item" column contains term names (e.g., "project name")
  - "Description" column contains expected value type hints (e.g., "[boolean]")
  - Checklist columns use uppercase (EU, BA, etc.)
  - "MIENS" was later renamed to "MIMARKS"
