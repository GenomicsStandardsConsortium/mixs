# MIxS v2.1 to v4 term mapping configuration (POOLED v2.1)
#
# IMPORTANT: This config is for comparing POOLED v2.1 files:
#   v2.1: Migs_mims_miens + MIMARKS
#   v4: MIxS_210514.xls (single file)
#
# The pooled v2.1 contains:
# - Core terms: environment, country, source_mat_identifiers, submit_to_insdc
# - MIMARKS terms: biome, feature, material, geo_loc_name, source_mat_id, submitted_to_insdc
#
# v4 standardized on env_* naming and restored some terms removed in v2.1.

renames:
  # Core v2.1 renames (new names back to old names in v4)
  country: geo_loc_name
  source_mat_identifiers: source_mat_id
  submit_to_insdc: submitted_to_insdc

splits:
  # Core v2.1's consolidated 'environment' was split back into three terms
  environment:
    targets:
      - env_biome
      - env_feature
      - env_material
    description: "Single 'environment' field was split into three ENVO-based terms for greater precision"

deletions:
  # MIMARKS terms that were superseded by the env_* terms in v4
  # (The env_* terms are accounted for by the environment split above)
  biome:
    reason: "MIMARKS term; superseded by env_biome in v4 (same concept, new naming)"
  feature:
    reason: "MIMARKS term; superseded by env_feature in v4 (same concept, new naming)"
  material:
    reason: "MIMARKS term; superseded by env_material in v4 (same concept, new naming)"
