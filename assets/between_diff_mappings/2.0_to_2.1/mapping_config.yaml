# MIxS v2.0 to v2.1 term mapping configuration (POOLED FILES)
#
# IMPORTANT: This config is for comparing POOLED files:
#   v2.0: MIGS_MIMS + MIENS
#   v2.1: Migs_mims_miens + MIMARKS
#
# Key observations about v2.1:
# - The core checklist (Migs_mims_miens) renamed several terms and consolidated environment
# - MIMARKS kept the OLD term names (geo_loc_name, source_mat_id, submitted_to_insdc)
# - MIMARKS also kept separate biome/feature/material terms
# - MIMARKS kept adapters and lib_const_meth terms
#
# When pooled, v2.1 contains BOTH old and new naming conventions because
# MIMARKS didn't follow the same renaming as the core checklists.
#
# Therefore: NO renames or merges are needed for pooled comparisons.
# The "new" terms in v2.1 are genuine additions from the core checklist reorganization:
# - country (renamed from geo_loc_name in core, but geo_loc_name kept in MIMARKS)
# - environment (consolidated from biome/feature/material in core, but originals kept in MIMARKS)
# - source_mat_identifiers (renamed from source_mat_id in core, but original kept in MIMARKS)
# - submit_to_insdc (renamed from submitted_to_insdc in core, but original kept in MIMARKS)

# No renames needed - MIMARKS kept old names, core has new names, both exist in pooled v2.1

# No merges needed - biome/feature/material exist in both versions (v2.0 and v2.1 MIMARKS)

deletions:
  # Only these terms were fully removed in v2.1 (not in core OR MIMARKS)
  annot_source:
    reason: "Removed in v2.1; re-added in v4"
  assembly_name:
    reason: "Removed in v2.1; re-added in v4"
  # Note: adapters and lib_const_meth were removed from core but kept in MIMARKS,
  # so they are shared terms when comparing pooled files
