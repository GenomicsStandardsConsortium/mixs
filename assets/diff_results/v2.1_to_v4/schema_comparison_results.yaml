          and as opposed to a particular digital record of a material sample) used for extracting nucleic acids, and subsequent
          sequencing. The identifier can refer either to the original material collected or to any derived sub-samples. The
          INSDC qualifiers /specimen_voucher, /bio_material, or /culture_collection may or may not share the same value as
          the source_mat_id field. For instance, the /specimen_voucher qualifier and source_mat_id may both contain 'UAM:Herps:14'
          , referring to both the specimen voucher and sampled tissue with the same identifier. However, the /culture_collection
          qualifier may refer to a value from an initial culture (e.g. ATCC:11775) while source_mat_id would refer to an identifier
          from some derived culture from which the nucleic acids were extracted (e.g. xatc123 or ark:/2154/R2).
