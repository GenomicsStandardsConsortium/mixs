    description: 'The IFSAC food categorization scheme has five distinct levels to
      which foods can be assigned, depending upon the type of food. First, foods are
      assigned to one of four food groups (aquatic animals, land animals, plants,
      and other). Food groups include increasingly specific food categories; dairy,
      eggs, meat and poultry, and game are in the land animal food group, and the
      category meat and poultry is further subdivided into more specific categories
      of meat (beef, pork, other meat) and poultry (chicken, turkey, other poultry).
      Finally, foods are differentiated by differences in food processing (such as
      pasteurized fluid dairy products, unpasteurized fluid dairy products, pasteurized
      solid and semi-solid dairy products, and unpasteurized solid and semi-solid
      dairy products. An IFSAC food category chart is available from https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/ifsac/projects/food-categorization-scheme.html

      Therefore, long term corrosion rates are generally more informative than short
      term rates and for that reason they are preferred during reporting. In the case
      of suspected MIC, corrosion rate measurements at the time of sampling might
      provide insights into the involvement of certain microbial community members

    comments:
    - This is a very broad package, intended to capture many kinds of sequences derived
      from the bodies of or derived from an organism. Where possible, please use a
      more specific package. For example, consider using food-animal and animal feed
      extension for sampling of farm animals reared for consumption. For human stool
      microbiomes, consider MIxS-human-gut. Incidental associations of environmental
      material with an organism may also be better served by other packages. For example,
      nucleic acids derived from soil that was sampled from the hoof of a cow may
      be better described by terms from the soil extension; however, soil embedded
      in a wound on a cow’s leg would be best described by terms in this extension
