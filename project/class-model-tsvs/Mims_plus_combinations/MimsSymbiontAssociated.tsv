For instance, the /specimen_voucher qualifier and source_mat_id may both contain 'UAM:Herps:14' , referring to both the specimen voucher and sampled tissue with the same identifier. However, the /culture_collection qualifier may refer to a value from an initial culture (e.g. ATCC:11775) while source_mat_id would refer to an identifier from some derived culture from which the nucleic acids were extracted (e.g. xatc123 or ark:/2154/R2)	{'value': 'MPI012345'}	nucleic acid sequence source	identifier|material|source	True		string	True				for cultures of microorganisms: identifiers for two culture collections; for other material a unique arbitrary identifer
