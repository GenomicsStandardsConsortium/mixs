# MIxS Editing Workflows and Good Practices

Please try to follow this document. First read the [policies](policy.md) document.

# Terms

## Requesting and creating a new term

## Requesting and implementing a term update


## Requesting and implementing a term deprecation 

# Checklists, extensions, and combinations

Define what they are

## Requesting and creating a new checklist or extension

## Updating an existing checklist or extension

# Releases

MIxS uses an automated GitHub Actions workflow to create release PRs. This ensures consistent versioning across all files and generates schema diffs automatically.

## Triggering a Release

1. Go to [Actions → Create Release PR](https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/actions/workflows/create-release-pr.yaml)
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Enter parameters:
   - `version`: New version number (e.g., `6.2.2` or `7.0.0`)
   - `diff_old`: Old version for comparison (default: `mixs6.0.0`)
   - `diff_new`: New version for comparison (default: `main`)
   - `skip_tests`: Optional, for faster iteration during development
4. Click **Run workflow**

The workflow will:
- Bump version numbers in `pyproject.toml`, `CITATION.cff`, `.zenodo.json`, and `release/README.md`
- Run the full build and test suite
- Generate a schema diff report in `assets/diff_results/`
- Create a release PR with all changes

## Reviewing a Release PR

### Pre-merge Checklist
- [ ] Review version numbers are correct
- [ ] Review schema diff for unexpected changes (see `assets/diff_results/schema_comparison_results.yaml`)
- [ ] Verify all tests passed
- [ ] TWG approval required
- [ ] CIG approval required (for major releases only)

### Review Guidance
If the review process identifies problems that were already merged into main by previous PRs, new issues should be opened to address them rather than blocking the release PR.

## Publishing a Release (Post-merge)

After the release PR is merged:

1. Go to [Releases → New Release](https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/releases/new)
2. Click **Choose a tag** in the upper left
3. Type the new version with `v` prefix (e.g., `v6.2.2`)
4. Click **Create new tag: vX.Y.Z on publish**
5. Set the target to `main`
6. Click **Generate release notes** to auto-populate from PR titles
7. Review and edit the release notes as needed
8. Click **Publish release**

## Release Publishing Permissions

Users with release publishing permission:
- **Admins**: @lschriml, @only1chunts
- **Maintain**: @sujaypatil96, @turbomam

## Versioning

MIxS uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) with three digits: `major.minor.patch`

- **Major** (e.g., 6.0.0 → 7.0.0): Significant changes, breaking changes, or major milestones
- **Minor** (e.g., 6.2.0 → 6.3.0): New features, new terms, or substantial additions
- **Patch** (e.g., 6.2.1 → 6.2.2): Bug fixes, typo corrections, minor clarifications

# Documentation
Autogenerated documentation is created with every PR
Sujay's fork allows you to preview what will be regenerated. Important for when the documentation technology changes.

------------------
Content copied over:

- All change requests to the GSC should be captured in an issue.
   - Issues should be descriptive and provide clear requests and changes. Issue templates are available and should be used when possible.
   - One change should be proposed per issue. If multiple issues are related, you can leverage a GitHub super issue to connect related items.

- All branches should be tied to issues and the branch name should relate to the issue it's tied to.
  - This can be accomplished easily using the GitHub "create a branch" tool when viewing the issue on the webpage.

- All pushes, pull requests, and changes should be related to a single issue, and issues should be a single change per issue.
  - Issues and their associated pull requests should be small and targeted. One change per issue and pull request.

- All branches and pull requests should be tied to an issue.

- When making a pull request, contributions can continue to be made and built, but within scope of the related issue.
  - Making a draft pull request can be done to confirm changes are being done correctly

- Provide a reviewer for pull requests. 
  - Pull requests must be reviewed by a member of the GSC Technical Working Group
  - A Pull request requires someone other than the person that created the pull request
  - Include issue author as a pull request reviewer

- Once a pull request is started, all further discussion, review, and changes, happen in the pull request (rather than the issue). 
  - ?? Using conversations within PRs (TODO: add links to GH documentation)

- When a pull request is merged, the associated branch should be deleted and issue closed.

- See the [Releases](#releases) section above for the automated release workflow.

- Contributions should NOT be made in a fork. 
  - If external parties make a fork, it should be tied to an issue. Forks will only be merged back in following the above criteria for branches and small changes.
  - It is expected that external parties will discuss with the Technical Working Group before making changes on a scale that require a fork (e.g. a new checklist or extension).
  - The preference is to avoid forks and will be reviewed on a case by case basis.
  - Whenever a fork is created, a Technical Working Group member will reach out to the creator

- Add require a description to the suggested new thing to the requirements
- New extensions or checklists should be tracked using GitHub Projects
