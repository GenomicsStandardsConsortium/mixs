This script generates a Markdown document based on the classes defined in a YAML schema using the `linkml` framework.
It's used in the used in `gendoc` Makefile target. It doesn't have a `tool.poetry.scripts` alias in the `pyproject.toml`
file, which would allow it to be invoked as a command-line utility using Poetry. Here's how it functions:

1. **Logging Setup**:
    - Initializes logging to display info-level logs and above, with a specific format including timestamps, logging
      level, and message.

2. **Command Line Arguments Handling**:
    - Checks if the script is called with exactly one argument (excluding the script name itself). If not, it logs an
      error and exits. This basic CLI mechanism doesn't use libraries like `click` or `argparse` but directly
      checks `sys.argv`.

3. **Document Generator Initialization**:
    - Creates an instance of `DocGenerator` configured to use specific directories and settings to generate
      documentation from a schema file located at `"src/mixs/schema/mixs.yaml"`.

4. **Markdown File Writing**:
    - Opens the specified output file for writing.
    - Writes a static header and table headers to the Markdown file.
    - Iterates over each class in the schema. If a class meets certain conditions (has mixins and a superclass), it
      writes a row into the Markdown file containing the class's link and description.

5. **Error Handling**:
    - Catches and logs any exceptions that occur during file operations, providing feedback if something goes wrong.

6. **Logging Completion**:
    - Logs a message upon successful writing of the Markdown file.

### Script Highlights:

- **Direct CLI Handling**: The script uses `sys.argv` directly for CLI input, checking for the correct number of
  arguments and providing usage instructions. This approach is simplistic and manually handles the parsing and
  validation of command-line arguments. It's suitable for scripts with minimal command-line interaction. For more
  complex CLI needs, integrating a library like `click` would offer advantages such as automatic help generation,
  command grouping, and argument validation.
- **Error Logging**: Robust logging for both operational logs and error handling.
- **File Writing**: Demonstrates file handling in Python, including writing structured content to a file in Markdown
  format.

### CLI Analysis:

- The script does not use a dedicated CLI framework like `click`. It interacts with the command line using
  Python's `sys` module. This method involves manually checking the number of command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) and
  handling errors directly related to these inputs. This method is straightforward but lacks the features of more
  developed CLI libraries like `click`, which can simplify the parsing of command-line arguments, provide built-in help
  messages, and facilitate error handling.
