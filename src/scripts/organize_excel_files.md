Used by the `gen-excel` Makefile target. No `tool.poetry.scripts` alias in the `pyproject.toml` file.

This Python script is designed to organize Excel files based on the categorization derived from a MIxS schema. It sorts
files into directories corresponding to different schema classifications such as Checklists and Extensions. Here's a
breakdown of the script's operations and structure:

1. **Imports and Setup**:
    - Imports necessary modules including `os` for directory manipulations, `shutil` for file operations, `defaultdict`
      from `collections` for data aggregation, `SchemaView` from `linkml_runtime` for schema operations, and `logging`
      and `argparse` for logging and command-line interface management.

2. **Class Definition: MIxSExcelFileOrganizer**:
    - A class is defined to encapsulate all functionality related to file organization based on a MIxS schema.
    - **Constructor (`__init__`)**:
        - Takes paths to the MIxS schema file, the source directory containing Excel files, and the base destination
          folder.
        - Initializes a logger for the class.
    - **Method: setup_logger**:
        - Configures and returns a logger object for logging information and warnings.
    - **Method: organize_files**:
        - Loads the schema using `SchemaView` and identifies classes categorized as "Checklist" and "Extension".
        - Organizes classes by their type and associations into a results dictionary.
        - For each extension class, attempts to copy its corresponding Excel file from the source directory to a new '
          extensions_only' directory.
        - For each checklist class, copies its associated Excel files and those of any related classes into categorized
          directories.
        - Logs warnings for any Excel files that are expected but not found in the source directory.

3. **Command-Line Interface Setup**:
    - Uses `argparse` to create a CLI that requires users to specify paths for the schema file, source directory, and
      destination folder.
    - Provides a default path for the schema file and makes the source and destination folder paths required arguments,
      ensuring that the user provides these essential inputs.

4. **Script Execution**:
    - The script is designed to be run from the command line. It parses arguments provided by the user and creates an
      instance of `MIxSExcelFileOrganizer` with these inputs.
    - Calls the `organize_files` method to perform the file organization based on the schema-defined classifications.

### Detailed Observations:

- **Effective Use of Libraries**: The script effectively utilizes Python's built-in libraries and external modules to
  handle file and directory operations, logging, and command-line interactions.
- **Structured and Modular Code**: By encapsulating functionality within a class and using methods for specific tasks,
  the script maintains a clean and modular code structure that enhances readability and maintainability.
- **Advanced File Management**: Demonstrates complex file management tasks including conditional file copying based on
  schema-derived logic, and dynamic directory creation based on schema categories.

### Overall Analysis:

- The script is well-organized and serves a specific functional purpose of categorizing and organizing Excel files based
  on a schema classification. It provides robust error handling and user interaction through command-line arguments,
  making it a practical tool for managing dataset files according to a predefined schema structure.
