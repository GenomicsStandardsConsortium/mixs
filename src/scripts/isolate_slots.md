This Python script processes a TSV file containing schema information, performing multiple data cleaning steps to refine
the dataset according to specified criteria. It's used by the `assets/mixs-schemasheets-concise-global-slots.tsv`
Makefile target.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Imports**:
    - The script imports the `pandas` library, which is essential for handling the data frame operations.
      The `sqlalchemy` library import and related database code are commented out, indicating optional functionality for
      database operations.

2. **Data Source and Destination Setup**:
    - Variables for the source TSV file (`source_schemasheets_file`) and the destination file (`destination_file`) are
      defined. A `destination_table_name` for potential database use is also specified but not currently active in the
      script.

3. **Data Loading**:
    - Reads the TSV file into a pandas DataFrame (`df`), specifying tab (`\t`) as the delimiter.

4. **Data Cleaning Steps**:
    - **Filtering Rows**:
        - Removes any rows where the first column starts with the character '>', which might signify metadata or
          comments in the file.
        - Keeps rows where the 'slot' column has a value, but the 'class' column does not, focusing on global slots that
          are not tied to any specific class.
        - Excludes rows where the 'domain' column equals 'MixsCompliantData', further refining the dataset.
    - **Column Cleanup**:
        - Drops any columns that are entirely null, cleaning up the data frame from unnecessary data.

5. **Data Output**:
    - Writes the cleaned DataFrame back to a TSV file, not including the index.

6. **Commented Database Interaction**:
    - Code for saving the DataFrame to a PostgreSQL database is provided but commented out. This includes creating a
      database engine, inserting data into a table, and disposing of the engine. This suggests optional functionality
      for users who might want to integrate the script with a database.

### Detailed Observations:

- **Selective Data Processing**: The script effectively uses pandas for selective data manipulation, showcasing typical
  data cleaning operations like filtering rows based on conditions and dropping irrelevant columns.
- **Modular Design for Extensibility**: By commenting out the database interaction code, the script remains modular,
  allowing users to easily activate this feature as needed. This approach is beneficial for maintaining the script's
  adaptability to different environments or requirements.
- **File-Based Data Management**: The primary focus of the script is file-based data handling, making it suitable for
  environments where database interaction is not required or desired.

### Overall Analysis:

- The script is well-organized for processing TSV files with schema data. It demonstrates practical data cleaning
  operations using pandas, making it a useful tool for data analysts or developers working with similar datasets. The
  optional database code provides flexibility for extending the script's functionality to include data persistence.
