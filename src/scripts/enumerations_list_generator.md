This Python script is designed to generate a Markdown document that details all the enumerations from a LinkML schema.
It's used in the used in `gendoc` Makefile target. It doesn't have a `tool.poetry.scripts` alias in the `pyproject.toml`
file, which would allow it to be invoked as a command-line utility using Poetry. Here's how it functions:

1. **Logging Setup**:
    - The script sets up logging to the INFO level, ensuring that timestamps, severity levels, and messages are part of
      the log entries. This helps in tracking the execution flow and diagnosing issues.

2. **CLI Handling with sys.argv**:
    - Directly checks the length of `sys.argv` to ensure exactly one argument is provided beyond the script name. If the
      argument count is incorrect, it logs an error message specifying the correct usage and exits. This method of
      handling CLI arguments is basic and does not use a specialized library like `click` or `argparse`. It manually
      checks and handles command-line inputs, suitable for scripts with minimal command-line interaction.

3. **Initialization of Document Generator**:
    - A `DocGenerator` instance is created with specified settings pointing to a schema file, template directory, and
      output directory. It is configured to use slot URIs and class URIs, enhancing the generated documentation's
      linking and referencing capabilities.

4. **Markdown File Generation**:
    - Opens the output Markdown file for writing. Starts by writing a header for enumerations.
    - Iterates through all enumeration objects fetched from the schema. For each enumeration, it writes a header with a
      link to the enumeration name and a table of its permissible values.

5. **Error Handling**:
    - Uses a try-except block to catch and log any exceptions during the file writing process. Errors are logged with a
      specific message detailing the issue, which aids in troubleshooting.

6. **Completion Logging**:
    - Upon successful writing of the Markdown file, it logs an informational message indicating the successful creation
      of the documentation.

### Detailed Observations:

- **Direct CLI Handling**: The script manages CLI inputs using `sys.argv`, which is straightforward but lacks the
  robustness and features of dedicated CLI frameworks like `click`. This approach is adequate for scripts that require
  minimal user interaction and command-line options.
- **Logging for Monitoring and Debugging**: The script uses Python’s built-in `logging` module effectively to monitor
  its operations and debug issues. This is crucial for maintaining good visibility of the script’s execution in
  production environments.
- **Structured Markdown Output**: The script demonstrates careful construction of a Markdown document programmatically,
  including dynamic content generation like links and tables based on the schema content.
- **Error Management**: The error handling is basic but functional, capturing any issues during file operations and
  logging detailed error messages.

### CLI Analysis:

- The script does not employ a CLI framework such as `click` but relies on the built-in `sys` module for handling
  command-line arguments. While this is adequate for simple scripts, using a library like `click` could provide enhanced
  parsing capabilities, automatic help and error messages, and a more structured approach to CLI design.
