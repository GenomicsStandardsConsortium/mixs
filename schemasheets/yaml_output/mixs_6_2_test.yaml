      /bio_material, or /culture_collection may or may not share the same value as
      the source_mat_id field. For instance, the /specimen_voucher qualifier and source_mat_id
      may both contain 'UAM:Herps:14' , referring to both the specimen voucher and
      sampled tissue with the same identifier. However, the /culture_collection qualifier
      may refer to a value from an initial culture (e.g. ATCC:11775) while source_mat_id
