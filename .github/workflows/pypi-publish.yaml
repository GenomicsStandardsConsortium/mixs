# DISABLED WORKFLOW - PyPI Publishing
# =============================================================================
# This workflow is DISABLED because MIxS has never been published to PyPI
# and there are no current plans to do so. The 'mixs' package does not exist
# on PyPI (verified December 2025).
#
# If PyPI publishing is needed in the future:
# 1. Create a PyPI account and API token
# 2. Add PYPI_PASSWORD secret to this repository
# 3. Enable poetry-dynamic-versioning in pyproject.toml
# 4. Uncomment the triggers below
#
# See: https://github.com/turbomam/mixs/issues/106
