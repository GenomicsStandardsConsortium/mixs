Please note that while the extensions are designed to be as inclusive as possible of terms appropriate to a particular environment or situations, individual users may choose to select any other additional term(s) from any extension for use with their own choice of packages without the need to request an update of the extension itself.
Only terms that would be widely applicable to all samples using the extension will be consider adding the term.
