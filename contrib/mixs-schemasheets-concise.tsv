IFSAC_category		Plants:Produce:Vegetables:Herbs:Dried Herbs		IFSAC term								The IFSAC food categorization scheme has five distinct levels to which foods can be assigned, depending upon the type of food. First, foods are assigned to one of four food groups (aquatic animals, land animals, plants, and other). Food groups include increasingly specific food categories; dairy, eggs, meat and poultry, and game are in the land animal food group, and the category meat and poultry is further subdivided into more specific categories of meat (beef, pork, other meat) and poultry (chicken, turkey, other poultry). Finally, foods are differentiated by differences in food processing (such as pasteurized fluid dairy products, unpasteurized fluid dairy products, pasteurized solid and semi-solid dairy products, and unpasteurized solid and semi-solid dairy products.

	HostAssociated					elephant fecal matter or cat oral cavity		MIxS-host-associated	MIXS:0016002	This is a very broad package, intended to capture many kinds of sequences derived from the bodies of or derived from an organism. Where possible, please use a more specific package. For example, consider using food-animal and animal feed extension for sampling of farm animals reared for consumption. For human stool microbiomes, consider MIxS-human-gut. Incidental associations of environmental material with an organism may also be better served by other packages. For example, nucleic acids derived from soil that was sampled from the hoof of a cow may be better described by terms from the soil extension; however, soil embedded in a wound on a cow’s leg would be best described by terms in this extension		A collection of terms appropriate when collecting samples and sequencing samples  obtained from a non-human host, to examine the host-associated microbiome or genome.			https://w3id.org/mixs				Extension													host-associated
