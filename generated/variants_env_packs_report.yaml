    air: The total concentration of all dissolved salts in a liquid or solid sample.
      While salinity can be measured by a complete chemical analysis, this method
      is difficult and time consuming. More often, it is instead derived from the
      conductivity measurement. This is known as practical salinity. These derivations
      compare the specific conductance of the sample to a salinity standard such as
