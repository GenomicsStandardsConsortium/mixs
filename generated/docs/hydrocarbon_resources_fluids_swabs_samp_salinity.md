# Slot: samp_salinity


Salinity is the total concentration of all dissolved salts in a liquid or solid (in the form of an extract obtained by centrifugation) sample. While salinity can be measured by a complete chemical analysis, this method is difficult and time consuming. More often, it is instead derived from the conductivity measurement. This is known as practical salinity. These derivations compare the specific conductance of the sample to a salinity standard such as seawater
